```Elon has N.apples and has made a few rules of several apple intakes:
1) Either he is going to eat a single apple in a day.
2) If the number of apples is divisible by 2, he is going to eat half of the apples.
3) If the number of apples is divisible by 5, then he is going
to eat (4/5)th part of the apples.
Find the minimum number of days required to finish all the
apples.```
